# Todo-List-App
A To-do App using Django Created by Kaiwen Yu

Based on the tutorial "How to Build A Todo App With Django" (https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/how-to-build-a-todo-app-with-django-17afdc4a8f8c)

Every To-do task has title, discription, priority, and due date. Click on the "Add Task" button, it will add the new task to the database. The task list will show all tasks in the database with a checkbox, a title, the discription, the created time and due date, and the priority label. Check the checkbox and click the "Delete Tasks" button, and those chosen tasks will be deleted.

Here is a example of the website
